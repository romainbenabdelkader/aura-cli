AURA CLI — Reference Demo (Testbed)

AURA CLI is a minimal command-line reference implementation demonstrating the core concepts of the AURA (European Origin Proof) public draft.

It provides a simple, auditable example of how a digital asset can be bound to a verifiable proof of origin using cryptographic primitives, without DRM, watermarking, monitoring, or platform control.

Demo video (reference only)

⚠️ Note
This video illustrates the conceptual workflow and an earlier version of the CLI.
The current codebase refines the trust model (TPKR registry, key handling, metadata) while preserving the same logical principles demonstrated in the video.

git clone https://github.com/romainbenabdelkader/aura-cli
cd aura-cli
pip install -r requirements.txt

1) Initialize a demo issuer + local TPKR registry

python aura_cli.py init \
  --org "Demo Org" \
  --country FR \
  --contact "demo@example.org"

This generates:
	•	an Ed25519 key pair (private key optionally encrypted via AURA_KEY_PASSWORD),
	•	issuer metadata,
	•	a local TPKR demo registry.

⸻

2) Issue an AURA manifest for a local asset

python aura_cli.py issue \
  --asset examples/example.wav \
  --asset-type audio \
  --tdm-opt-out

This produces a signed .aura.json manifest bound to the asset hash.

⸻

3) Verify the asset against its manifest

python aura_cli.py verify \
  --asset examples/example.wav \
  --manifest examples/example.wav.aura.json
Expected behaviour
	•	✅ original file → VALID
	•	✅ identical copy → VALID
	•	❌ modified file → INVALID

What this demo shows

This repository demonstrates, in the simplest possible form:
	•	cryptographic binding between an asset and a manifest,
	•	deterministic canonicalisation of the manifest (demo profile),
	•	Ed25519 signatures,
	•	issuer resolution via a registry (TPKR demo),
	•	explicit separation between:
	•	proof of origin,
	•	enforcement,
	•	monitoring.

⸻

What this demo does not do

This is a reference demonstration only.

It does not implement:
	•	DRM
	•	watermarking
	•	fingerprinting
	•	similarity detection
	•	content recognition
	•	usage monitoring
	•	platform-side enforcement

No rights are enforced.
No platforms are controlled.
No content is analysed beyond hashing.

Files generated by the demo
	•	issuer_private.pem
Private key (optionally encrypted using AURA_KEY_PASSWORD)
	•	issuer_public.pem
Public key
	•	issuer.json
Issuer metadata
	•	tpk_registry.json
Local TPKR demo registry (non-governed)
	•	*.aura.json
AURA manifests bound to assets

⸻

Security & trust model (demo only)
	•	The trust registry is local and not governed.
	•	Registry state can be modified locally (testbed assumption).
	•	In a real deployment:
	•	the registry would be governed,
	•	its state (or hash) would be published or anchored,
	•	issuer onboarding would follow defined governance rules.

This demo intentionally keeps the trust model explicit and inspectable.

⸻

GDPR / personal data

This CLI is designed to operate without personal data.

It processes only:
	•	local files,
	•	cryptographic hashes,
	•	signatures,
	•	keys,
	•	optional non-identifying issuer metadata.

No personal data is required.

⸻

Scope and intent

AURA CLI is:
	•	a technical reference,
	•	a testbed artifact,
	•	a discussion support tool for regulators, institutions and engineers.

It is not production software.

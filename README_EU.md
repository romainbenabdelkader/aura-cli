AURA CLI — EU Testbed Reference Implementation

Context and purpose

AURA CLI is a minimal, open-source reference implementation designed to support experimentation, discussion and evaluation around proof of origin, provenance and consent documentation for digital assets in the context of AI systems.

It is developed as a testbed artefact, aligned with European public policy objectives, including:
	
•	the AI Act (transparency, provenance, accountability),
	
•	copyright and TDM opt-out frameworks,
	
•	digital trust and evidentiary infrastructure needs.

This repository does not represent a commercial product.
It is intended as a neutral, auditable technical demonstrator.

Positioning

AURA CLI is deliberately positioned as:
	
•	Non-commercial
	
•	Open and pre-standard
	
•	Platform-independent
	
•	Non-intrusive

It does not rely on:
	
•	DRM,
	
•	watermarking,
	
•	content recognition,
	
•	usage monitoring,
	
•	or platform enforcement mechanisms.

Its role is strictly documentary and evidentiary.

What this testbed demonstrates

The CLI demonstrates how a digital asset can be associated with a verifiable proof of origin through:
	
•	cryptographic hashing of the asset,
	
•	deterministic canonicalisation of a manifest,
	
•	Ed25519 digital signatures,
	
•	issuer identification and resolution via a registry (TPKR demo),
	
•	explicit declaration of rights-related signals (e.g. TDM opt-out).

The result is a verifiable, time-stamped, auditable proof, suitable as a technical appendix for:
	
•	regulatory compliance,
	
•	audits,
	
•	contractual relationships,
	
•	cross-border interoperability.

⸻

Trust model (testbed)

This implementation uses a local Trust Public Key Registry (TPKR) for demonstration purposes.

Key characteristics:
	
•	issuers are identified by a cryptographic fingerprint,
	
•	public keys are resolved via a registry,
	
•	the registry is not governed in this demo.

This reflects a testbed assumption.

In a production or EU-scale deployment:
	
•	issuer onboarding would follow governance rules,
	
•	registry state would be governed,
	
•	registry hashes could be published or anchored (e.g. public bulletin, ledger, or EU trust infrastructure).

The trust model is intentionally explicit and inspectable, not implicit.

Demo video (reference only)

🎥 Conceptual demonstration video (earlier version):

⚠️ Important note
The video illustrates the conceptual workflow.
The current codebase refines:
	
•	issuer metadata handling,
	
•	trust registry logic,
	
•	key management and resilience.

The underlying principles remain unchanged.

Technical scope (intentionally limited)

Included
	
•	SHA-256 asset hashing
	
•	Ed25519 signatures
	
•	Deterministic manifest canonicalisation (demo profile)
	
•	Issuer resolution via registry
	
•	Explicit separation between:
	
•	documentation,
	
•	enforcement,
	
•	monitoring

Explicitly excluded
	
•	DRM
	
•	watermarking
	
•	fingerprinting
	
•	similarity detection
	
•	content recognition
	
•	usage tracking
	
•	platform-side controls

No rights are enforced.

No platforms are controlled.

No content is analysed beyond hashing.

Files generated by the testbed
	
•	issuer_private.pem
Private key (optionally encrypted via AURA_KEY_PASSWORD)
	
•	issuer_public.pem
Public key
	
•	issuer.json
Issuer metadata (non-identifying)
	
•	tpk_registry.json
Local TPKR demo registry
	
•	*.aura.json

⸻

GDPR and personal data

This testbed is designed to operate without personal data.

It processes only:
	
•	local files,
	
•	cryptographic hashes,
	
•	signatures,
	
•	keys,
	
•	optional non-identifying issuer metadata.

No personal data is required or inferred.

⸻

Intended audience

This repository is intended for:
	
•	European institutions,
	
•	regulators and policy teams,
	
•	innovation agencies,
	
•	standardisation bodies,
	
•	researchers and engineers.

It serves as:
	
•	a technical reference,
	
•	a testbed artefact,
	
•	a discussion support tool for policy and regulatory implementation.

Status
	
•	Draft / testbed implementation
	
•	Not production software
	
•	Subject to evolution alongside the AURA public draft

EU-facing summary (one sentence)

AURA CLI demonstrates how a neutral, non-intrusive and auditable proof-of-origin infrastructure could support the operational implementation of EU transparency and provenance requirements, without enforcing rights or controlling platforms.

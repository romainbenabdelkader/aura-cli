# > 🎬 Short demo video (tamper detection & origin proof):
## 🚀 30‑second demo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/romainbenabdelkader/aura-cli
cd aura-cli
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Initialize demo issuer keys
python aura_cli.py init

# Issue a manifest for the example asset
python aura_cli.py issue --asset examples/example.wav --asset-type audio --tdm-opt-out

# Verify the asset against its manifest
python aura_cli.py verify --asset
examples/example.wav --manifest
examples/example.wav.aura

This demo specifically illustrates that:

- an asset can be bound to a cryptographic proof of origin,

- the proof is verifiable offline and independently,

- and any modification of the asset (even minimal) immediately breaks the proof.


AURA CLI (reference demo)

Not related to Neo4j “Aura CLI”.

This repository contains a minimal command-line tool demonstrating the core concepts of the AURA (European Origin Proof) Public Draft standard.

It issues and verifies a signed AURA manifest for a local digital asset (audio, image, text, video) using cryptographic hashes and Ed25519 signatures.

## Reference demo only

This CLI is a reference demonstration of the AURA draft. It is not production-ready and does not implement a full trust registry (TPKR). 

It does not perform DRM, watermarking, fingerprinting, similarity detection, or content recognition.

## What this demo illustrates

- Hashing a local asset (SHA3-256)
  
- Issuing a signed AURA manifest (JSON)
  
- Verifying asset integrity and manifest signature
  
- Expressing a simple rights signal (TDM opt-out)
  
- Offline, portable proof of origin (no platform dependency)

## Demo scenario (as shown in the video)

1. Verify an original asset against its AURA manifest → VALID

2. Make a copy of the asset → still VALID

3. Alter the copied file (even by 1 byte)

4. Verify again → FAIL (asset hash mismatch)

This demonstrates that the AURA proof is strictly bound to the binary content of the asset.

## Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Quick start
	1.	Initialise a local issuer (demo keys)

python aura_cli.py init

2.	Issue an AURA manifest

python aura_cli.py issue --asset example.wav --asset-type audio --tdm-opt-out

This generates a .aura manifest file next to the asset.
	3.	Verify an AURA manifest (local issuer keys)

python aura_cli.py verify --asset example.wav --manifest example.wav.aura

Third-party verification

This demo can also verify a manifest using an external issuer public key (PEM):

python aura_cli.py verify --asset example.wav --manifest example.wav.aura --public-key issuer_public.pem

CLI reference

Initialise issuer keys

python aura_cli.py init

Issue

python aura_cli.py issue --asset PATH --asset-type audio|image|text|video --manifest OUTPUT.aura --tdm-opt-out

Verify

python aura_cli.py verify --asset PATH --manifest PATH.aura --public-key issuer_public.pem

Files generated by this demo

•	issuer_private.pem (demo private key)

•	issuer_public.pem (demo public key)

•	issuer.json (demo issuer metadata)

•	*.aura (AURA manifests)

## ⚠️ Important notice

This repository is a **reference demonstration only**.

It does NOT implement:
- any trust registry
- any identity verification
- any timestamp authority
- any governance or legal framework

It only demonstrates a **cryptographic integrity and proof-of-origin binding mechanism**.

It is NOT a production system.

**In this project, “proof-of-origin”
refers strictly to cryptographic
integrity and issuance claims, not to
legal ownership or authorship.**

Security / limitations (demo only)

•	Keys are generated and stored locally without passphrase (demo only).

•	This is a minimal reference workflow, not a trust framework.

•	Key distribution, revocation and trust levels (TPKR) are out of scope here.

•	Not intended for production use.

GDPR / personal data

This CLI is designed to operate without personal data.
It processes local assets and cryptographic material only (hashes, signatures, and keys).

## Relation to AUTHENTICA

This CLI demonstrates only the **cryptographic integrity layer**.

It is a building block of a broader
evidence infrastructure (AUTHENTICA),
which also includes:
- identity and issuer governance
- trusted timestamping
- legal and institutional frameworks
- long-term archival and auditability

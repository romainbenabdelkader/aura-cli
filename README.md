# AURA CLI (reference demo)

## 🚀 30-second demo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/romainbenabdelkader/aura-cli
cd aura-cli
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Initialize demo issuer keys
python aura_cli.py init

# Issue a manifest for the example asset
python aura_cli.py issue --asset examples/example.wav --asset-type audio --tdm-opt-out

# Verify the asset against its manifest
python aura_cli.py verify --asset examples/example.wav --manifest examples/example.wav.aura
This reproduces exactly the behavior shown in the demo video:
• original file → VALID
• identical copy → still VALID
• modified file → INVALID
What this demo shows

This demo illustrates that:
• a digital asset can be bound to a cryptographic proof of origin,
• the proof is verifiable offline and independently,
• any modification of the asset (even minimal) immediately breaks the proof.

AURA CLI (reference demo)

Not related to Neo4j “Aura CLI”.

This repository contains a minimal command-line tool demonstrating the core concepts of the AURA (European Origin Proof) - Public Draft standard.

It issues and verifies a signed AURA manifest for a local digital asset (audio, image, text, video) using cryptographic hashes and Ed25519 signatures.

⸻

Reference demo only

This CLI is a reference demonstration of the AURA draft.

It is not production-ready and does not implement a full trust registry (TPKR).

It does not perform DRM, watermarking, fingerprinting, similarity detection, or content recognition.

⸻

What this demo illustrates
• Hashing a local asset (SHA3-256)
• Issuing a signed AURA manifest (JSON)
• Verifying asset integrity and manifest signature
• Expressing a simple rights signal (TDM opt-out)
• Offline, portable proof of origin (no platform dependency)

⸻

Demo scenario (as shown in the video)
	1.	Verify an original asset against its AURA manifest → VALID
	2.	Make a byte-for-byte copy of the asset → still VALID
	3.	Alter the copied file (even by 1 byte)
	4.	Verify again → FAIL (asset hash mismatch)

This demonstrates that the AURA proof is strictly bound to the binary content of the asset.

Requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

Quick start

1. Initialise a local issuer (demo keys)
python aura_cli.py init
2. Issue an AURA manifest
python aura_cli.py issue --asset example.wav --asset-type audio --tdm-opt-out
This generates a .aura manifest file next to the asset.

3. Verify an AURA manifest
python aura_cli.py verify --asset example.wav --manifest example.wav.aura

The issuer public key is embedded in the manifest, allowing independent verification without access to the issuer environment.

CLI reference

Initialise issuer keys:
python aura_cli.py init
Issue:
python aura_cli.py issue --asset PATH --asset-type audio|image|text|video --manifest OUTPUT.aura --tdm-opt-out
Verify:
python aura_cli.py verify --asset PATH --manifest PATH.aura
Files generated by this demo
• issuer_private.pem (demo private key)
• issuer.json (demo issuer metadata)
• *.aura (AURA manifests containing the embedded public key)

⚠️ Important notice

This repository is a reference demonstration only.

It does NOT implement:
• any trust registry
• any identity verification
• any timestamp authority
• any governance or legal framework

It only demonstrates a cryptographic integrity and proof-of-origin binding mechanism.

It is NOT a production system.

In this project, “proof-of-origin” refers strictly to cryptographic integrity and issuance claims, not to legal ownership, authorship, or copyright title.

⸻

Security / limitations (demo only)
• Keys are generated and stored locally without passphrase (demo only).
• This is a minimal reference workflow, not a trust framework.
• Key distribution, revocation and trust levels (TPKR) are out of scope.
• Not intended for production use.

⸻

GDPR / personal data

This CLI is designed to operate without personal data.

It processes local assets and cryptographic material only (hashes, signatures, and keys).

⸻

Relation to AUTHENTICA

This CLI demonstrates only the cryptographic integrity layer.

It is a building block of a broader evidence infrastructure (AUTHENTICA), which also includes:
• identity and issuer governance
• trusted timestamping
• legal and institutional frameworks
• long-term archival and auditability

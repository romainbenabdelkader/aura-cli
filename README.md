AURA CLI (reference demo)

Short demo video (tamper detection & origin proof):
https://youtu.be/hyGM4gvHMXI

30-second demo
git clone https://github.com/romainbenabdelkader/aura-cli
cd aura-cli
pip install -r requirements.txt

Initialize demo issuer keys + local TPKR registry
python aura_cli.py init --org "Demo Org" --country FR --contact "demo@example.org"

Issue a manifest for the example asset
python aura_cli.py issue --asset examples/example.wav --asset-type audio --tdm-opt-out

Verify the asset against its manifest
python aura_cli.py verify --asset examples/example.wav --manifest examples/example.wav.aura.json

Expected behavior:
- original file -> VALID
- identical copy -> still VALID
- modified file -> INVALID

What this demo shows

This repository contains a minimal command-line tool demonstrating the core concepts of the AURA (European Origin Proof) public draft.

It issues and verifies a signed AURA manifest for a local digital asset (audio, image, text, video) using:
- SHA-256 hashing
- Ed25519 signatures
- a minimal local issuer registry (TPKR demo)

Reference demo only

This CLI is a reference demonstration of the AURA draft.
It is not production-ready and does not implement a governed trust registry.
It does not perform DRM, watermarking, fingerprinting, similarity detection, or content recognition.

Files generated by this demo
- issuer_private.pem (private key, optionally encrypted via AURA_KEY_PASSWORD)
- issuer_public.pem (public key)
- issuer.json (issuer metadata)
- tpk_registry.json (local TPKR registry - demo)
- *.aura.json (AURA manifests)

Security / limitations (demo only)
- Trust model is testbed / demo: the registry is local and not governance-anchored.
- In a real deployment, the registry state must be governed and its hash anchored/published.
- Not intended for production use.

GDPR / personal data
This CLI is designed to operate without personal data.
It processes local assets and cryptographic material only (hashes, signatures, keys).

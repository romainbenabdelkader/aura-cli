# AURA - Non-Goals and Scope Boundaries

AURA is a reference standard for cryptographic proof of origin.
It is deliberately minimal, non-executive, and non-prescriptive.

This document defines what AURA explicitly refuses to be.

---

## Voluntary Incapabilities

AURA is deliberately incapable of:

- blocking a model
  
- preventing execution
  
- enforcing platform behavior
  
- imposing policy
  
- making legal determinations
  
- collecting personal or usage data
  
- monitoring or tracking activity
  
- acting as DRM
  
- becoming a proprietary API
  
- asserting control over downstream systems

AURA produces verifiable artefacts only.

It does not act on them.

---

## Non-Objectives

AURA has no objective to:

- become an execution infrastructure
  
- be operated by a private company
  
- be controlled by a cloud provider
  
- embed enforcement logic
  
- monetize access to the standard
  
- define business models or incentives
  
- replace legal, regulatory, or judicial processes

---

## Design Principle

AURA must remain valid even if no execution environment exists.

Its artefacts must be:

- self-sufficient
  
- verifiable by third parties
  
- meaningful without platform cooperation

Any system that consumes AURA artefacts does so independently.
Such systems are explicitly out of scope.

---

## Sovereignty Constraint

If AURA required coupling with infrastructure, platforms, or enforcement,
it would no longer be a standard it would be vendor lock-in.

This constraint is non-negotiable.

---

## Summary

AURA does not solve problems.
AURA defines a verifiable reference point.

It exists so that facts can be proven,
even when authority, trust, or governance fail.
